As I got the chance to explore New Orleans, I took hundreds of photos capturing the architecture, people, and objects of New Orleans. I grew a lot as a photographer through this trip as I paid closer attention to the small details of the city and grew more confident in asking people if I could take their portraits. It also helped me realize that I love to document places, people and events in my photography. It forces me to look at the area with a new perspective. It allows me to find beauty in all aspects of the space and helps calm some of my anxiety.",
